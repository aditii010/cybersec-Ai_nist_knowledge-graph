This project builds a complete knowledge graph of the NIST SP 800-53 framework using OSCAL data.

The graph captures:
- Control families (Groups)
- Controls and enhancements (recursive structure)
- Parameters and guidance parts
- Baselines and profiles (if extended)

The output is stored as a graph and visualized using Neo4j.
